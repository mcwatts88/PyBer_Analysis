# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Ride-sharing data was analyzed for V. Isualize in order to see how ride-sharing is utilized among different city types. The project utilized Pandas dataframes and Matplotlib visualizations to work with and display the data. The total weekly fares were calculated for each city type in order to determine the best way to utilize company resources going forward.

## Results

In order to compare each city type, the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type were calculated. These can be viewed below in the dataframe.

The urban ride count made up the majority of the rides taken and also generated the most total money. There were more drivers than rides taken in urban cities. This led to a lower fare per driver and fare per ride in urban cities. The rural cities generated the least amount of money but the rides were more lucrative in this area. The suburban areas generated a higher fare per ride than urban areas and the driver pool was not oversaturated leading to higher fares per driver in these areas.

A weekly summary from 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019 was requested and generated. This graphical summary can be seen below.

The rural areas did not generate much fare revenue during this period. The urban areas generated the most with the most popular stretch lasting from the end of February to mid-April. There was a spike at the end of February that affected every city type.

## Summary

Three recommendations can be suggested based on this data.

* Incentivize suburban areas as they generate a good amount of money and the area is not overserved.

* Rural areas, while lucrative when a ride occurs, do not generate many fares. Focusing on these city types would not be preferable.

* Try to divert some drivers away from urban areas as the number of rides was surpassed by drivers, meaning supply is outpacing demand. If the supply can be spread to surrounding suburban areas then more fares can be generated.
